# Bandit Zones

The index/home page for this section is located in `pages/bandit-zone.mdx` (notice the slug is your section name)

The additional menu is created by creating a folder inside `pages` named as your slug/section name (so `bandit-zone`) and populating this folder with `.mdx` files (markdown)
